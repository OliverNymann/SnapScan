# SnapScan

A Python-based :snake: desktop application for quickly scanning QR codes directly from your computer screen.

## Purpose

- **Automatically decode the QR code and perform appropriate actions.**
- **Open URLs in your browser, copy text to clipboard, etc.**

## Features

- **QR Code Decoding:** Utilizes the `pyzbar` library for accurate and efficient QR code decoding.
- **URL Handling:** Opens detected URLs in your default web browser.
- **Text Handling:** Copies decoded text to the clipboard.
- **Error Handling:** Provides feedback if no QR code is found or if it's invalid.

## Future Features

- **History:** Maintain a history of scanned QR codes for easy reference.
- **Customizable Actions:** Allow users to define actions for different QR code data types.
- **Batch Scanning:** Scan multiple QR codes within a selected area.
- **Improved Selection:** Enhance the user interface for selecting QR codes on the screen.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Ensure compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux. (Long term)
